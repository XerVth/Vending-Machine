# Vending Machine Simulator with phaser.js

A small **vending machine simulator** built as a small personal project. The goal was to keep the logic simple, clear, and easy to extend (for example to use it as a reward feature in a game).

## Features

* Product selection with prices
* Basic payment handling
* Change calculation
* Handles common edge cases (for example not enough money)

## How It Works

1. Insert the money
2. Select a product
3. The machine checks balance
4. Product is dispensed and change is returned
